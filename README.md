The Spanish Diminutive Generator or 'generador de diminutivos'...
Input a word (like 'casa' or 'caf√©') and get its Spanish diminutive version (like 'casita' or 'cafecito').


## User Stories Goals
Simple search box centered in the page.
Current and stretch goals for the project:
- Enter a word, hit submit, and get your final diminutive form
- As a user types, they should receive autocomplete suggestions
- Stretch: Add before and after images using Google (or Unsplash's, or anyone's) API to emphasize the diminutive form. (eg. enter 'gato' to receive 'gatito', the left side of the screen will show image results for gato, the right side of the screen will show image results for a tiny, little cat or 'gatito')
